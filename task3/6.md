## Task 10: Simulate a Merge Conflict

### 1. First make a new file in both the existing branches
```
    git checkout main
    echo "123" >> conflict.txt
```
### 2. Add and commit
```
    git add conflict.txt
    git commit -m "Added conflict.txt in main branch"
```
### 3. Switch to the new branch and repeate the same process
```
    git checkout feature
    echo "456" >> conflict.txt
    git add conflict.txt
    git commit -m "Added conflict.txt
```
### 4. merge two branches
```
    git checkout main
    git merge feature
```
