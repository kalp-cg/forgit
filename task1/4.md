## Part 4: Additional Practice

### Task 16: Simulate Team Collaboration
Create a repository and share it with a friend.
Both make changes to the same file simultaneously.
Practice resolving merge conflicts and pushing changes.

### Task 17: Git Ignore
Create a .gitignore file:
```
echo "node_modules/" > .gitignore
```
Add files and ensure ignored files are not staged:
```
git add .
```
